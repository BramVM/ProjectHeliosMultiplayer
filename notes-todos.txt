Notes to self:

Find good way to use modular services and dependency injection (not require) (important foor modding platform)

Wil draw ship on canvas by bezier curves so the art will be very open for prcedural generation.

How to define planet textures


Performance issue collision of bullets.
Checking for collision of every bullet with anything on each frame tick consumes alot of resources. (to much)
improvement idea: predict wich target might get hit and onely check for collision with those targets
improvement idea: on fire predict if and when the bullet is going to hit something based on known variables and update the prediction when those variables change. (tricky to predict, do we know all needed variables?)
improvement idea: change the gameplay and combatSystem so fire always requires target lockon and bullets are just fast cosmetic particles
